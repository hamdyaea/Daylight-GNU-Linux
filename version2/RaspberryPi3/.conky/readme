Now go conky-manager folder in home and open and you will see a folder called themes. Now open and you will also some pre-installed themes already. please leave this folder open

In my super conky pack there is a folder called Themes now open and copy all the themes and put into conky-manager folded under themes. ( do not copy folder just files into folder.)

now open conky manager and refresh the list and you should see the list with all the great cool conky.

Please Note not all conkys will work on some systems.2 core computers will not be able to load 4 core conkys.

***** Most Conky Configs are for gnome works great Cinnamon will need to make some mods to work properly Unity. *****
